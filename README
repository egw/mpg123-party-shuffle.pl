Usage
=====

    ./mpg123-party-shuffle.pl ~/path/to/music ~/path/to/more/music ....

Design Goals
============

In no particular order,

  . command line-based
  . party shuffle, like in itunes or amarok
  . manually add/remove tracks
  . don't want to load/maintain database, just use filesystem

Right now this uses mpg321 instead of mpg123 because mpg123 keeps on
dying randomly on my netbook.
