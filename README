Description
===========

A simple terminal-based mp3 player/party shuffler.

The biggest difference between mpg123-party-shuffler.pl and other players'
party shuffles is how random songs are chosen.  Instead of picking from
a flat list (where each song has an equal chance of being chosen) or a
weighted list based on ratings, mpg123-party-shuffler.pl descends down
the directory structure every time it wants to choose a song.

This means there will be many more directory operations over the running
time of the program and that the queue will be biased towards songs
shallower in the tree.  The benefits are that no database of available
songs needs to be maintained and that changes to the directory (like
adding or moving or removing songs) show up immediately.

Right now this uses mpg321 instead of mpg123 because mpg123 keeps on
dying randomly on my netbook.

Usage
=====

  ./mpg123-party-shuffle.pl ~/path/to/music ~/path/to/more/music ....

Design Goals
============

In no particular order,

  . command line-based
  . party shuffle, like in itunes or amarok
  . manually add/remove tracks
  . don't want to load/maintain database, just use filesystem

Todos (maybe)
=============

Also in no particular order,

  x scrobble
  x read id3 tags (mpg123 and mpg321 do this, so it's mostly parsing
    the @I output.)
  . ratings (save to id3 POPM (popularimeter) tag)
  . update id3 play counter
  . curses
  . play ogg
  . dance, dance, dance!
  . readline and/or tab-completion
  . light/medium/heavy rotation directories

Bugs
====

The scrobbling isn't ideal.  It calls user.updateNowPlaying at the start
of a song (which is good), but then calls track.scrobble at 80% through
the song.  This means last.fm doesn't think anything is happening for
the last 20% of the song.  Maybe move track.scrobble to the very end?
Maybe queue up track.scrobble at 80%, but only send it at the end?
